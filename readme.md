# WIP
Please keep in mind I am working on ONE game at a time, I will do game requests on my discord server when I make it.
I will also announce and do polls on what games YOU want me to add next, and the option of 4 games.
If the game has a good anticheat (ex: ER:LC) I will not make a script for it, so please test around so I can keep pumping out stuff for you guys
[Go to AR2 Section](#AR2)

-All scripts tested on Argon, I will not guarantee support with any other executors. 
Argon is the BEST free executor and has 100% sUNC + 100% UNC, and is available for everyone to use below: 
https://discord.gg/theargon 

 -Please report any issues or errors in issues in this format: (USE THE F9 IN GAME CONSOLE)
 Doing Error reports in such way will help me fix your issue
 
 -EXECUTOR USED:
 
 -FULL ERROR (the more descriptive u are the easier and faster I can fix it):
 
 -PICTURE/VIDEO OF ERROR: (ss ur screen) or use OBS, upload it to streamable, and attach the streamable link as well
 
 -TIMESTAMP:

# AR2
(Apocalypse Rising 2)
- Please execute when you have fully spawned in, and **NOT** In the main menu where you customize your character
- this will break the esp (both player and loot, as the items haven't rendered in yet)

TO DO (AR2):
- [x] -- ESP (player) --
- [ ] ESP (loot) - HALFWAY! (need to parse through containers and grab item names)
- [ ] Hitbox Expander (HEAD)
- [ ] No Recoil (With Percentages on a slider) (In script Hub)
- [ ] No Spread (Bullets always go in the middle of the crosshair
- [ ] Instant Reload
- [ ] Aim assist of some kind (with a UI LIB)
- [ ] Make most if not all executors supported
- [ ] Make a script hub with it and add more features
